# Getting Started With Making Your Own Python Package

The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.
So all python packages are stored in PyPi

__Create the files in the following order__

&nbsp; |--- LICENSE <br/>
&nbsp; |--- README.md <br/>
> &nbsp;     |--- example_pkg <br/>
> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;       |---    \__init__.py <br/>
> &nbsp; |--- setup.py <br/>
> &nbsp; |--- tests <br/>

```python
def name():
